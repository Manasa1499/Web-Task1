<p>Bengaluru (also called Bangalore) is the capital of India's southern Karnataka state. 
The center of India's high-tech industry, the city is also known for its parks and nightlife.By Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha is a Neo-Dravidian legislative building. 
Former royal residences include 19th-century Bangalore Palace, modeled after Englands Windsor Castle, and Tipu Sultans Summer Palace, an 18th-century teak structure.
</p>

<p>The city's history dates back to around 890 AD, in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, 
Bangalore. The Begur inscription is written in Halegannada (ancient Kannada), mentions 'Bengaluru Kalaga' (battle of Bengaluru). 
It was a significant turning point in the history of Bangalore as it bears the earliest reference to the name 'Bengaluru' In 1537 CE, 
Kemp Gowda a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern Bengaluru and its oldest areas, or 
petes, which exist to the present day. After the fall of Vijayanagar empire in 16th century, the Mughals sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar.

<p>Bangalore is widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading information technology (IT) 
exporter. Indian technological organisations such as ISRO, Infosys, Wipro and HAL are headquartered in the city. A demographically diverse city, 
Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in India. Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Bangalore either the fourth or 
fifth-most productive metro area of India.
